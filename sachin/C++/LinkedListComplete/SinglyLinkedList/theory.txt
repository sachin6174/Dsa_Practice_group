before this we were having 2 ways to store data>
variable and array
variable (for single piece of data)
Array (to store multiple data of same type) 
=>size of array is fixed(tell students why in relevence of operating system ,fragmentaion, and indextable alternative of linked list)
//array has continuous memory sllocation  and the next space after the last element may be used by any other process(no gurrentee of space)

// as to remove elements from array  and addition is also problem 
so we introduced a new data structure called as linked list or uniary tree.

array->place data at continuous memory loaction and 
linkd list ->place at random memory loactionin 
in linked list u can add as much element as needed according to the requirement;

so we need to save all the data address:(created at random locations)
so one way is to store all the address of all the data put at random location in array
and the second way is that say each element to store address of next element to it and we can save the address of first element with us 

||data||address_of_next_node ||
so if we make a normal variable then only data will be stored
and if we make pointer to save address of address_of_next_node THEN only address will be saved
so we do not have builtin data type for this so we will make our own data type


// if int address stored in int datatype pointer then the node address will be stored in node data type pointer
-> array if fixed in length   tell why to students
->linked list have size limitation which is limitation of hardware
make input and print function as static class method
( we can also do a node class and a linked list class which will have methods and will only have head)

if we create node in main function then we have to link in main as pointer will be destroyed it main only so pointer buddhi will not be applied

for (;head!=NULL;){

}

is same as 
while(head!=NULL){

}

learn head->address_of_next_node
is same as (*head).address_of_next_node
chaining (*((*head).address_of_next_node)).address_of_next_node
