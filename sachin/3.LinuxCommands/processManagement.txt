Here are some commonly used Linux commands for process management:

ps: Displays information about running processes on the system, including their PID (Process ID), CPU and memory usage, and other details.

top: Provides an interactive view of system processes in real-time, with the ability to sort by different metrics and send signals to selected processes.

kill: Sends a signal to a specified process, which can be used to terminate or modify its behavior.

pkill: Similar to kill, but allows you to specify a process by name rather than PID.

pgrep: Searches for processes by name or other criteria and returns their PIDs.

nice: Sets the priority level of a process, which determines how much CPU time it is allocated.

renice: Changes the priority level of an already-running process.

htop: Similar to top, but provides a more user-friendly interface with color-coded displays and mouse support.

pstree: Displays a tree-like overview of all running processes, showing their relationships and parent-child dependencies.

systemctl: A command-line tool for controlling system services, allowing you to start, stop, restart, enable, or disable them as needed.

These are just a few examples of process management commands in Linux. Depending on your needs and specific use case, there may be others that are more useful to you.
