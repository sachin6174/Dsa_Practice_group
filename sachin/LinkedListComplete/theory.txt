before this we were having 2 ways to store data>
variable and array
variable (for single piece of data)
Array (to store multiple data of same type) 
=>size of array is fixed(tell students why in relevence of operating system ,fragmentaion, and indextable alternative of linked list)
//array has continuous memory sllocation  and the next space after the last element may be used by any other process(no gurrentee of space)
