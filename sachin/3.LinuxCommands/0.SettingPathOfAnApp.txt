To set the path for an app in Linux, you can follow these steps:

Determine the directory where the app is installed.

Open your terminal and type the following command to edit the .bashrc file: nano ~/.bashrc

If you want to set the path for all users, open the file /etc/profile instead.-> it is a file open with v

Scroll down to the end of the file and add the following line:

export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/directory
Replace "/path/to/directory" with the actual directory where the app is installed.

Save the changes by pressing "Ctrl + X", then "Y", and finally "Enter".

To apply the changes, either log out and log back in or type the following command in your terminal: source ~/.bashrc.

Verify that the path has been correctly set by typing the name of the app in the terminal. If it launches without any errors, the path has been set successfully.

Note: If the app requires additional libraries or dependencies, you may need to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable as well. Follow the same process as above, but replace "PATH" with "LD_LIBRARY_PATH".
