Here are some commonly used Linux commands for networking:

ifconfig: Displays information about network interfaces, including IP address, MAC address, and network settings.

ip: Similar to ifconfig, but with more advanced features such as routing tables, network namespaces, and network device configuration.

route: Displays the system's routing table, which determines how network traffic is directed.

ping: Sends an ICMP echo request to a specified IP address or hostname to test connectivity.

traceroute: Displays the path that network traffic takes from one host to another, including any network hops along the way.

netstat: Displays active network connections, open ports, and other network-related statistics.

tcpdump: Captures and displays network traffic in real-time.

ss: Provides detailed information on TCP and UDP sockets and network connections.

nc: A simple utility for sending and receiving data over TCP or UDP connections.

wget: Downloads files from the Internet using HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP protocols.

These are just a few of the many networking commands available in Linux. Depending on your needs and specific networking setup, there may be others that are more useful to you.
