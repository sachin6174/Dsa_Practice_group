apt-get: This command is used to manage packages in Ubuntu and Debian-based distributions. It can be used to install, remove, update, and upgrade packages.

dpkg: This command is used to install individual .deb packages in Debian-based distributions. It can also be used to query the status of installed packages.

yum: This command is used to manage packages in Red Hat-based distributions, such as CentOS and Fedora. It can be used to install, remove, update, and upgrade packages.

rpm: This command is used to install individual .rpm packages in Red Hat-based distributions. It can also be used to query the status of installed packages.

pacman: This command is used to manage packages in Arch Linux and its derivatives. It can be used to install, remove, update, and upgrade packages.

zypper: This command is used to manage packages in SUSE Linux and its derivatives. It can be used to install, remove, update, and upgrade packages.

portage/emerge: These commands are used to manage packages in Gentoo Linux. They can be used to install, remove, update, and upgrade packages.
